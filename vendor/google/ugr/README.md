# UGR Cluster & Hub Deployment

This set of templates, configuration files and scripts use the [GCP Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs) service to deploy and update the undergraduate research GKE cluster and node pools.

The documentation below starts from the highest level -- the Deployment Scripts -- and drills down into the two supporting layers beneath (Configurations, Templates).


## Deployment Scripts (gcloud wrapped in shell)

The deployment shell scripts are wrapped around gcloud commands to add a bit of convenience. This convenience boils down to the following:

```
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ... || \
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update ...
```

That is, the script will run the create version; if this fails (due to the deployement already existing), then it will update the deployment, only taking actions to effect changes in the "deltas" between the live deployment and the new local configuration.

Deployments may be destroyed wholesale with "one click" in the web console, or with gcloud as described in the shell script comments:

```
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete "$DEPLOYMENT_NAME"
```
## Configurations (yaml)

Each deployment shell script (above) "knows" its config, e.g.

```
CONFIG_PATH="./configs/gke_ugresearch.yaml"
```

[The yaml file for a templated config](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/templates/define-template-properties) contains all of the configuration variable values, such as resource names, numbers, sizes, and other parameters; for example,

```
      initialNodeCount: 1
      diskSizeGb: 100
      machineType: n2-standard-2
```

## Custom Templates (python)

The yaml config files (above) work with [templates](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/templates/create-basic-template) to feed the full deployment specifications to the shell script's gcloud command. The yaml specifies the template(s) that the deployment manager should use for the deployment:

```
imports:
  - path: ../templates/gke_template.py
```

When choosing python for the template language, the following function is expected:

```
def GenerateConfig(context):
```

At deployment, the template has access to the properties set in the associated yaml, and this function's one job is to return a dictionary that descries the deployment:

```
    return {'resources': resources}
```

Note that this python is run "in the cloud" by the deployment manager service, not locally in the gcloud context.

## Adding a Node Pool

To add a node pool, such as ugr02, create these two files (based on the ugr01 example):

```
.//configs/node_pool_ugr02.yaml
.//deploy_node_pool_ugr02.sh
```

Edit the yaml config to have the names and properties of your new node pool, and edit the shell script's CONFIG_PATH to reference the new yaml config.

The associated template is meant to be unchanged; it contains the structure, not the configuration:

```
templates/node_pool_template.py
```

Run the shell script to deploy:

```
./deploy_node_pool_ugr02.sh
```

## Change a deployment

To change an existing deployment, edit the parameters to be changed in the deployment's yaml config and run its associated shell script.

Note that not all parameters can be updated in place. For example, node pool autoscaling (such as min/max numbers and on/off) can be updated on the "hot" deployment, but other config settings (e.g., machine type and disk size) require the resources to first be undeployed, then deployed anew with the new configuration.
