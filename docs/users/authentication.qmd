title: User Authentication
---

UC Berkeley uses a [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/) instance,
called [bcourses.berkeley.edu](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu). Almost
all our hubs use this for authentication, although [not all yet](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/1574).

## Who has access?

Anyone who can log in to bcourses can log into our JupyterHubs. This
includes all berkeley affiliates. If you have a working berkeley.edu
email account, you can most likely log in to bcourses, and hence to
our JupyterHubs.

Students have access for 9 months after they graduate. If they have
an incomplete, they have 13 months of access instead.

## Non-berkeley affiliates

If someone who doesn't have a berkeley.edu account wants to use
the JupyterHubs, they need to get a [CalNet Sponsored Guest
account](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/calnet-sponsored-guests)
This gives people access to [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu),
and hence to all the JupyterHubs.

## Troubleshooting

If you can log in to [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu) but
not to any of the JupyterHubs, please contact us.

If you can not log in to bcourses, please [contact bcourses support](https://dls.berkeley.edu/services/bcourses-0)
