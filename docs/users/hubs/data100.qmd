This hub is for [Data 100](http://www.ds100.org/) which has a unique
user and grading environment.

Data100 has shared folders between staff (professors and GSIs) and
students. Course staff can see a `shared` and a `shared-readwrite`
folder. Students can only see the `shared` folder, which is read-only.
Anything that gets put in `shared-readwrite` is automatically viewable
in `shared`, but as read-only files. The purpose of this is to be able
to share large data files instead of having one per student.
