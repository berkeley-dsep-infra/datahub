This page lists the various environments, applications, and tools we offer on
DataHub. Not all those listed here are available on all hubs, but we can easily enable them.

## Programming Languages

We support the usual suspects - Python, R, and Julia. However, Jupyter and
other applications can support many more. If you would like to use a
different, open-source programming language, contact us.

## Applications

Our diverse user population has diverse needs, so we offer many different
user interfaces for instructors to choose from.

### JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) is a more modern and customizable version of the classic Jupyter notebook from the Jupyter project.
Most of our classes use JupyterLab.


### Jupyter Notebook (Classic)

This familiar interface is used for most of our introductory classes. It is document oriented, no-frills, and well known by a lot of people.

### RStudio

![RStudio Screenshot](images/rstudio.png)

We want to provide first class support for teaching with R, which means
providing strong support for [RStudio](https://rstudio.com). This also includes support for running Shiny applications.

Try RStudio [on DataHub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu) with your berkeley.edu account, or [on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rocker-org/binder/master?urlpath=rstudio) without a berkeley.edu account.

### Remote Desktop

Sometimes, you just need to use something that requires a full desktop
environment to run. Instead of trying to get students to install things
locally, we offer a full fledged Linux Desktop environment they can
access from inside their browser! This is just a different 'UI' on the
same infrastructure as the notebook environment, so they all use the
same libraries and home directories.

Try remote desktop [on EECS DataHub](https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/desktop) with your berkeley.edu account, or [on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yuvipanda/jupyter-desktop-server/master?urlpath=desktop) without a berkeley.edu account.

### Visual Studio Code

![Compile C with vscode](images/vscode.png)

Sometimes you *just* want an IDE, not a notebook environment. We are experimenting
with a hosted, web version of the popular Visual Studio Code editor, to
see if it would be useful for teaching more traditional CS classes.

Try VS Code [on EECS DataHub](https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/vscode/) with your berkeley.edu account, or [on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/vscode-binder/master?urlpath=lab) without a berkeley.edu account.

### Other Web Applications

We can make many web based applications work on a hub. Contact us and we'll see what we can do!

### Postgresql

Some of our classes require using real databases to teach. We
now experimentally offer a [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
server for each user on the [data100 hub](https://data100.datahub.berkeley.edu).

The data does not persist right now, but we can turn that on whenever
needed.
