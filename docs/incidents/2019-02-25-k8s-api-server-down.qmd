## Summary

On February 25, 2019, the kubernetes API server for data100 became unreachable, causing new resource creation requests to fail. When the hub pod was stopped, a new one did not get created leading users to see a proxy error message. The hub came back online after a new cluster was created, storage was migrated to the new cluster, and then DNS was updated.

## Timeline

### 2019-02-25 11:21a

The kubernetes API server became unavailable. The time of this event was determine post mortem via the cloud provider's monitoring metrics.

### 11:34

Infrastructure staff is notified in slack. It is determined that the hub proxy is up, but kubectl fails for all operations. The API server is unreachable.

### 11:57

A C ticket is created via the cloud provider's portal. There are no other reports on the cloud provider's status page. Infrastructure staff consider creating a new cluster and attaching storage to it.

### 12:28p

An email is sent to contacts with the cloud provider asking for the ability to escalate the issue. C tickets have 8 hour response times.

### 12:40

It is decided that rather than moving the nfs server from one cluster to another, the ZFS pool should be migrated to a new nfs server in the new cluster. The new cluster is requested.

### 12:43 - 12:49

Cloud provider responds and calls infrastructure staff.

### 13:00

The cluster is created and a new nfs server is requested in the cluster's resource group.

### 13:10

Data volumes are detached from the old server and moved from the old cluster's resource group to the new one.

## 13:20

The ZFS pool is imported into the new nfs server. helm is run to create the staging hub.

## 13:34

helm completes and the staging hub is up. DNS is updated. helm is run to create the prod hub.

## 13:41

prod hub is up and DNS is updated.

### 13:46

Cloud provider asks their upstream why the API server went down.

### 14:48

letsencrypt on prod can successfully retrieve an SSL certificate enabling students to connect.

## Conclusion

The managed kubernetes service went down for as yet unknown reasons. A new cluster was created and existing storage was attached to it.

## Action items

### Monitoring

1. Remotely monitor the API server endpoint and send an alert when it is down.
