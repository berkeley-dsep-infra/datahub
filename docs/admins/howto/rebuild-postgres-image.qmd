title: "Customize the Per-User Postgres Docker Image"
---

We provide each student on `data100` witha postgresql server. We want the
[python extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html)
installed. So we inherit from the [upstream postgresql docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres), and add the appropriate
package.

This image is in `images/postgres`. If you update it, you need to
rebuild and push it.

1. Modify the image in `images/postgres` and make a git commit.
2. Run `chartpress --push`. This will build and push the image, *but
   not put anything in YAML*. There is no place we can put thi in
   `values.yaml`, since this is only used for data100.
3. Notice the image name + tag from the `chartpress --push` command,
   and put it in the appropriate place (under `extraContainers`) in
   `data100/config/common.yaml`.
4. Make a commit with the new tag in `data100/config/common.yaml`.
5. Proceed to deploy as normal.
