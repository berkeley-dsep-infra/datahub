      $ conda install sphinx
      $ rst2html.py <filename>.rst > <filename>.html

Strategy 3: free online previewer

Use a free, online, in-line converter such as: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_restructure_editor.php

Strategy 4: Visual Studio code extension
========================================

The VSCode extension `RSTPreview
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.rst-vscode>`_ provides a live preview of
your reStructuredText file as you edit it within VSCode. You may have to check the extensionâ€™s settings
to set a non-conflicting keystroke sequence for opening the preview pane.
