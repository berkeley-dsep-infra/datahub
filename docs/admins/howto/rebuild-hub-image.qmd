title: "Customize the Hub Docker Image"
---

We use a customized JupyterHub docker image so we can install extra packages
such as authenticators. The image is located in `images/hub`. It *must* inherit
from the JupyterHub image used in the [Zero to
JupyterHub](https://z2jh.jupyter.og).

The image is build with [chartpress](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartress),
which also updates `hub/values.yaml` with the new image version.
`chartpress` may be installed locally with `pip install chartpress`.

1. Run `gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev` *once
   per machine* to setup docker for authentication with the [gcloud
   credential
   helper](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication).
2. Modify the image in `images/hub` and make a git commit.
3. Run `chartpress --push`. This will build and push the hub image, and
   modify `hub/values.yaml` appropriately.
4. Make a commit with the `hub/values.yaml` file, so the new hub image
   name and tag are comitted.
5. Proceed to deployment as normal.

Some of the following commands may be required to configure your
environment to run the above chartpress workflow successfully:

 - `gcloud auth login`.
 - `gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`
 - `gcloud auth application-default login`
 - `gcloud auth configure-docker`
