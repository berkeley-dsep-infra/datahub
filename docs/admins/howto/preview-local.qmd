title: Develop Documentation

## Live Preview

Navigate to the `docs` directory and run `quarto preview`. You can view the
documentation in a browser while you make changes.

## Render Static HTML

Navigate to the `docs` directory and run `quarto render`. This will build the
entire website in the `_site` directory. You can then open files in your web
browser.

You can also render individual files, which saves time if you do not want to
render the whole site. Run `quarto render ./path/to/filename.qmd`, and then open
the corresponding HTML file in the _site directory.
