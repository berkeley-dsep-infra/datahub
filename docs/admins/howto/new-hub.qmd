## Why create a new hub?

The major reasons for making a new hub are:

1. A new course wants to join the Berkeley DataHub community.
2. One of your *students* are course staff in another course and have *elevated access*, enabling them to see other students' work.
3. You want to use a different kind of authenticator.
4. You are running in a different cloud, or using a different billing
   account.
5. Your environment is different enough and specialized enough that a
   different hub is a good idea. By default, everyone uses the same
   image as datahub.berkeley.edu.
6. You want a different URL (X.datahub.berkeley.edu vs just
   datahub.berkeley.edu)

Please let us know if you have some other justification for creating a new hub.

## Prerequisites

Working installs of the following utilities:

  -   [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases)
  -   [hubploy](https://hubploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  -   [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  -   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  -   [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)

Proper access to the following systems:

  -   Google Cloud IAM: *owner*
  -   Write access to the [datahub repo](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub)
  -   Owner or admin access to the [berkeley-dsep-infra organization](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/)

## Configuring a New Hub

### Name the hub

Choose the hub name, e.g. *data8*, *stat20*, *biology*, *julia*, which is typically the name of the course or department. This is permanent.

### Determine deployment needs

Before creating a new hub, have a discussion with the instructor about
the system requirements, frequency of assignments and how much storage
will be required for the course. Typically, there are three general
"types" of hub: Heavy usage, general and small courses.

Small courses will usually have one or two assignments per semester, and
may only have 20 or fewer users.

General courses have up to \~500 users, but don't have large amount of
data or require upgraded compute resources.

Heavy usage courses can potentially have thousands of users, require
upgraded node specs and/or have Terabytes of data each semester.

Both general and heavy usage courses typically have weekly assignments.

Small courses (and some general usage courses) can use either or both of
a shared node pool and filestore to save money (Basic HDD filestore
instances start at 1T).

This is also a good time to determine if there are any specific software
packages/libraries that need to be installed, as well as what
language(s) the course will be using. This will determine which image to
use, and if we will need to add additional packages to the image build.

If you're going to use an existing node pool and/or filestore instance,
you can skip either or both of the following steps and pick back up at
the `cookiecutter`.

When creating a new hub, we also make sure to label the filestore and
GKE/node pool resouces with both `hub` and
`<nodepool|filestore>-deployment`. 99.999% of the time, the values for
all three of these labels will be `<hubname>`.

### Creating a new node pool

Create the node pool:

``` bash
gcloud container node-pools create "user-<hubname>-<YYYY-MM-DD>" \
  --labels=hub=<hubname>,nodepool-deployment=<hubname> \
  --node-labels hub.jupyter.org/pool-name=<hubname>-pool \
  --machine-type "n2-highmem-8" \
  --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes "0" --max-nodes "20" \
  --project "ucb-datahub-2018" --cluster "spring-2024" \
  --region "us-central1" --node-locations "us-central1-b" \
  --node-taints hub.jupyter.org_dedicated=user:NoSchedule --tags hub-cluster \
  --image-type "COS_CONTAINERD" --disk-type "pd-balanced" --disk-size "200"  \
  --metadata disable-legacy-endpoints=true \
  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append" \
  --no-enable-autoupgrade --enable-autorepair \
  --max-surge-upgrade 1 --max-unavailable-upgrade 0 --max-pods-per-node "110"
```

### Creating a new filestore instance

Before you create a new filestore instance, be sure you know the
capacity required. The smallest amount you can allocate is 1T, but
larger hubs may require more. Confer with the admins and people
instructing the course and determine how much they think they will need.

We can easily scale capacity up, but not down.

From the command line, first fill in the instance name
(`<hubname>-<YYYY-MM-DD>`) and `<capacity>`, and then execute the
following command:

``` bash
gcloud filestore instances create <hubname>-<YYYY-MM-DD> \
  --zone "us-central1-b" --tier="BASIC_HDD" \
  --file-share=capacity=1TiB,name=shares \
  --network=name=default,connect-mode=DIRECT_PEERING
```

Or, from the web console, click on the horizontal bar icon at the top
left corner.

1.  Access "Filestore" > "Instances" and click on "Create Instance".
2.  Name the instance `<hubname>-<YYYY-MM-DD>`
3.  Instance Type is `Basic`, Storage Type is `HDD`.
4.  Allocate capacity.
5.  Set the region to `us-central1` and Zone to `us-central1-b`.
6.  Set the VPC network to `default`.
7.  Set the File share name to `shares`.
8.  Click "Create" and wait for it to be deployed.
9.  Once it's deployed, select the instance and copy the "NFS mount
    point".

Your new (but empty) NFS filestore must be seeded with a pair of
directories. We run a utility VM for NFS filestore management; follow
the steps below to connect to this utility VM, mount your new filestore,
and create & configure the required directories.

You can run the following command in gcloud terminal to log in to the
NFS utility VM:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh nfsserver-01 --zone=us-central1-b --tunnel-through-iap
```

Alternatively, launch console.cloud.google.com > Select *ucb-datahub-2018* as
the project name.

1.  Click on the three horizontal bar icon at the top left corner.
2.  Access "Compute Engine" > "VM instances" > and search for
    "nfs-server-01".
3.  Select "Open in browser window" option to access NFS server via
    GUI.

Back in the NFS utility VM shell, mount the new share:

``` bash
mkdir /export/<hubname>-filestore
mount <filestore share IP>:/shares /export/<hubname>-filestore
```

Create `staging` and `prod` directories owned by `1000:1000` under
`/export/<hubname>-filestore/<hubname>`. The path *might* differ if your
hub has special home directory storage needs. Consult admins if that's
the case. Here is the command to create the directory with appropriate
permissions:

``` bash
install -d -o 1000 -g 1000 \
  /export/<hubname>-filestore/<hubname>/staging \
  /export/<hubname>-filestore/<hubname>/prod
```

Check whether the directories have permissions similar to the below
directories:

``` bash
drwxr-xr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu     45 Nov  3 20:33 a11y-filestore
drwxr-xr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu     33 Jan  4  2022 astro-filestore
drwxr-xr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu  16384 Aug 16 18:45 biology-filestore
```

### Create the hub deployment locally

In the `datahub/deployments` directory, run `cookiecutter`. This sets up
the hub's configuration directory:

``` bash
cookiecutter template/
```

The cookiecutter template will prompt you to provide the following information:

:   -   `<hub_name>`: Enter the chosen name of the hub.
    -   `<project_name>`: Default is `ucb-datahub-2018`, do not change.
    -   `<cluster_name>`: Default is `spring-2024`, do not change.
    -   `<pool_name>`: Name of the node pool (shared or individual) to
        deploy on.
    -   `hub_filestore_share`: Default is `shares`, do not change.
    -   `hub_filestore_ip`: Enter the IP address of the filestore
        instance. This is available from the web console.
    -   `hub_filestore_capacity`: Enter the allocated storage capacity.
        This is available from the web console.

This will generate a directory with the name of the hub you provided
with a skeleton configuration and all the necessary secrets.

### Configure filestore security settings and GCP billing labels

If you have created a new filestore instance, you will now need to apply
the `ROOT_SQUASH` settings. Please ensure that you've already created
the hub's root directory and both `staging` and `prod` directories,
otherwise you will lose write access to the share. We also attach labels
to a new filestore instance for tracking individual and full hub costs.

Skip this step if you are using an existing/shared filestore.

``` bash
gcloud filestore instances update <filestore-instance-name> --zone=us-central1-b  \
       --update-labels=hub=<hubname>,filestore-deployment=<hubname> \
       --flags-file=<hubname>/config/filestore/squash-flags.json
```

### Authentication

Set up authentication via [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu). We
have two canvas OAuth2 clients setup in bcourses for us - one for all
production hubs and one for all staging hubs. The configuration and
secrets for these are provided by the cookiecutter template, however the
new hubs need to be added to the authorized callback list maintained in
bcourses.

1. Use `sops` to edit `secrets/staging.yaml` and `secrets/prod.yaml`, replacing the
   cookiecutter hub_name. `cookiecutter` can't do this for you since
   the values are encrypted.

2. Add `<hub_name>-staging.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/oauth_callback` to the
   staging hub client (id 10720000000000594)

3. Add `<hub_name>.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/oauth_callback` to the
   production hub client (id 10720000000000472)

4. Copy gke-key.json from any other hub's secrets to the hub's secrets/

Please reach out to Jonathan Felder to set this up, or
<bcourseshelp@berkeley.edu> if he is not available.

### CI/CD and single-user server image

CI/CD is managed through Github Actions, and the relevant workflows are located
in `.github/workflows/`.  Deploying all hubs are managed via Pull Request
Labels, which are applied automatically on PR creation.

To ensure the new hub is deployed, all that needs to be done is add a new entry
(alphabetically) in `.github/labeler.yml` under the `# add hub-specific labels
for deployment changes` stanza:

``` yaml
"hub: <hubname>":
  - "deployments/<hubname>/**"
```

#### Hubs using a custom single-user server image

If this hub will be using its own image, then follow the
[instructions here](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/admins/howto/new-image.html)
to create the new image and repository.  In this case, the image tag will be
`PLACEHOLDER` and will be updated AFTER your PR to datahub is merged.

*NOTE:* The changes to the `datahub` repo are required to be merged BEFORE the new
image configuration is pushed to `main` in the image repo.  This is due to
the image building/pushing workflow requiring this deployment's
`hubploy.yaml` to be present in the `deployments/<hubname>/` subdirectory, as
it updates the image tag.

#### Hubs inheriting an existing single-user server image

If this hub will inherit an existing image, you can just copy `hubploy.yaml`
from an existing deployment which will contain the latest image hash.

#### Review the deployment's `hubploy.yaml`

Next, review `hubploy.yaml` inside your project directory to confirm that
looks cromulent.  An example from the `a11y` hub:

``` yaml
images:
  images:
    - name: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ucb-datahub-2018/user-images/a11y-user-image:<image tag OR "PLACEHOLDER">
```

### Create placeholder node pool

Node pools have a configured minimum size, but our cluster has the
ability to set aside additional placeholder nodes. These are nodes that
get spun up in anticipation of the pool needing to suddenly grow in
size, for example when large classes begin.

If you are deploying to a shared node pool, there is no need to perform
this step.

Otherwise, you'll need to add the placeholder settings in
`node-placeholder/values.yaml`.

The node placeholder pod should have enough RAM allocated to it that it
needs to be kicked out to get even a single user pod on the node - but
not so big that it can't run on a node where other system pods are
running! To do this, we'll find out how much memory is allocatable to
pods on that node, then subtract the sum of all non-user pod memory
requests and an additional 256Mi of "wiggle room". This final number
will be used to allocate RAM for the node placeholder.

1.  Launch a server on https://*hubname*.datahub.berkeley.edu
2.  Get the node name (it will look something like
    `gke-spring-2024-user-datahub-2023-01-04-fc70ea5b-67zs`):
    `kubectl get nodes | grep *hubname* | awk '{print $1}'`
3.  Get the total amount of memory allocatable to pods on this node and
    convert to bytes:
    ```bash
    kubectl get node <nodename> -o jsonpath='{.status.allocatable.memory}'
    ```
4.  Get the total memory used by non-user pods/containers on this node.
    We explicitly ignore `notebook` and `pause`. Convert to bytes and
    get the sum:
    ```bash
    kubectl get -A pod -l 'component!=user-placeholder' \
      --field-selector spec.nodeName=<nodename> \
      -o jsonpath='{range .items[*].spec.containers[*]}{.name}{"\t"}{.resources.requests.memory}{"\n"}{end}' \
      | egrep -v 'pause|notebook'
    ```

1.  Subract the second number from the first, and then subtract another
    277872640 bytes (256Mi) for "wiggle room".
2.  Add an entry for the new placeholder node config in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
data102:
  nodeSelector:
    hub.jupyter.org/pool-name: data102-pool
  resources:
    requests:
      # Some value slightly lower than allocatable RAM on the node pool
      memory: 60929654784
  replicas: 1
```

For reference, here's example output from collecting and calculating
the values for `data102`:

``` bash
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ kubectl get nodes | grep data102 | awk '{print$1}'
gke-spring-2024-user-data102-2023-01-05-e02d4850-t478
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ kubectl get node gke-spring-2024-user-data102-2023-01-05-e02d4850-t478 -o jsonpath='{.status.allocatable.memory}' # convert to bytes
60055600Ki%
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ kubectl get -A pod -l 'component!=user-placeholder' \
--field-selector spec.nodeName=gke-spring-2024-user-data102-2023-01-05-e02d4850-t478 \
-o jsonpath='{range .items[*].spec.containers[*]}{.name}{"\t"}{.resources.requests.memory}{"\n"}{end}' \
| egrep -v 'pause|notebook' # convert all values to bytes, sum them
calico-node
fluentbit       100Mi
fluentbit-gke   100Mi
gke-metrics-agent       60Mi
ip-masq-agent   16Mi
kube-proxy
prometheus-node-exporter
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ # subtract the sum of the second command's values from the first value, then subtract another 277872640 bytes for wiggle room
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ # in this case:  (60055600Ki - (100Mi + 100Mi + 60Mi + 16Mi)) - 256Mi
(gcpdev) ➜  ~ # (61496934400 - (104857600 + 104857600 + 16777216 + 62914560)) - 277872640 == 60929654784
```

Besides setting defaults, we can dynamically change the placeholder
counts by either adding new, or editing existing, [calendar
events](calendar-scaler.qmd).
This is useful for large courses which can have placeholder nodes set
aside for predicatable periods of heavy ramp up.

### Commit and deploy to `staging`

Commit the hub directory, and make a PR to the the `staging` branch in
the GitHub repo. 

#### Hubs using a custom single-user server image

If this hub is using a custom image, and you're using `PLACEHOLDER` for the
image tag in `hubploy.yaml`, be sure to remove the hub-specific Github
label that is automatically attached to this pull request.  It will look
something like `hub: <hubname>`.  If you don't do this the deployment will
fail as the image sha of `PLACEHOLDER` doesn't exist.

After this PR is merged, perform the `git push` in your image repo.  This will
trigger the workflow that builds the image, pushes it to the Artifact Registry,
and finally creates a commit that updates the image hash in `hubploy.yaml` and
pushes to the datahub repo.  Once this is merged in to `staging`, the
deployment pipeline will run and your hub will finally be deployed.

#### Hubs inheriting an existing single-user server image

Your hub's deployment will proceed automatically through the CI/CD pipeline.

It might take a few minutes for HTTPS to work, but after that you
can log into it at <https://>\<hub_name\>-staging.datahub.berkeley.edu.
Test it out and make sure things work as you think they should.

### Commit and deploy to `prod`

Make a PR from the `staging` branch to the `prod` branch. When this
PR is merged, it'll deploy the production hub. It might take a few
minutes for HTTPS to work, but after that you can log into it at
<https://>\<hub_name\>.datahub.berkeley.edu. Test it out and make
sure things work as you think they should.
