title: Kubernetes Cluster Configuration
---

We use [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to run our JupyterHubs. It
has a healthy open source community, managed offerings from multiple
vendors & a fast pace of development. We can run easily on many
different cloud providers with similar config by running on top of
Kubernetes, so it is also our cloud agnostic abstraction layer.

We prefer using a managed Kubernetes service (such as [Google Kubernetes
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)). This document
lays out our preferred cluster configuration on various cloud providers.

## Google Kubernetes Engine

In our experience, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has been the most
stable, performant, and reliable managed kubernetes service. We prefer
running on this when possible.

A `gcloud container clusters create` command can succintly express the
configuration of our kubernetes cluster. The following command
represents the currently favored configuration.

This creates the GKE cluster. It may host one or more node pools:

``` bash
gcloud container clusters create \
     --enable-ip-alias \
     --enable-autoscaling \
     --max-nodes=20 --min-nodes=1 \
     --region=us-central1 --node-locations=us-central1-b \
     --image-type=cos_containerd \
     --disk-size=100 --disk-type=pd-balanced \
     --machine-type=n2-highmem-8 \
     --cluster-version latest \
     --no-enable-autoupgrade \
     --enable-network-policy \
     --create-subnetwork="" \
     --tags=hub-cluster \
     <cluster-name>
```

Here\'s how we add a node pool to the cluster, beyond the default pool:

``` bash
gcloud container node-pools create  \
    --machine-type n2-highmem-8 \
    --num-nodes 1 \
    --enable-autoscaling \
    --min-nodes 1 --max-nodes 20 \
    --node-labels hub.jupyter.org/pool-name=<pool-name>-pool \
    --node-taints hub.jupyter.org_dedicated=user:NoSchedule \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --image-type=cos_containerd \
    --disk-size=200 --disk-type=pd-balanced \
    --no-enable-autoupgrade \
    --tags=hub-cluster \
    --cluster=<cluster-name> \
    user-<pool-name>-<yyyy>-<mm>-<dd>
```

### IP Aliasing

`--enable-ip-alias` creates [VPC Native
Clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips).

This becomes the default soon, and can be removed once it is the
default.

### Autoscaling

We use the [kubernetes cluster
autoscaler](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler)
to scale our node count up and down based on demand. It waits until the
cluster is completely full before triggering creation of a new node -
but that\'s ok, since new node creation time on GKE is pretty quick.

`--enable-autoscaling` turns the cluster autoscaler on.

`--min-nodes` sets the minimum number of nodes that will be maintained
regardless of demand. This should ideally be 2, to give us some headroom
for quick starts without requiring scale ups when the cluster is
completely empty.

`--max-nodes` sets the maximum number of nodes that the cluster
autoscaler will use - this sets the maximum number of concurrent users
we can support. This should be set to a reasonably high number, but not
too high - to protect against runaway creation of hundreds of VMs that
might drain all our credits due to accident or security breach.

### Highly available master

The kubernetes cluster\'s master nodes are managed by Google Cloud
automatically. By default, it is deployed in a non-highly-available
configuration - only one node. This means that upgrades and master
configuration changes cause a few minutes of downtime for the kubernetes
API, causing new user server starts / stops to fail.

We request our cluster masters to have [highly available
masters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/regional-clusters)
with `--region` parameter. This specifies the region where our 3 master
nodes will be spread across in different zones. It costs us extra, but
it is totally worth it.

By default, asking for highly available masters also asks for 3x the
node count, spread across multiple zones. We don\'t want that, since all
our user pods have in-memory state & can\'t be relocated. Specifying
`--node-locations` explicitly lets us control how many and which zones
the nodes are located in.

### Region / Zone selection

We generally use the `us-central1` region and a zone in it for our
clusters -simply because that is where we have asked for
[quota](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas).

There are regions closer to us, but latency hasn\'t really mattered so
we are currently still in us-central1. There are also unsubstantiated
rumors that us-central1 is their biggest data center and hence less
likely to run out of quota.

### Disk Size

`--disk-size` sets the size of the root disk on all the kubernetes
nodes. This isn\'t used for any persistent storage such as user home
directories. It is only used ephemerally for the operations of the
cluster - primarily storing docker images and other temporary storage.
We can make this larger if we use a large number of big images, or if we
want our image pulls to be faster (since disk performance [increases
with disk size](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance)
).

`--disk-type=pd-standard` gives us standard spinning disks, which are
cheaper. We can also request SSDs instead with `--disk-type=pd-ssd` - it
is much faster, but also much more expensive. We compromise with
`--disk-type=pd-balanced`, faster than spinning disks but not as fast as
ssds all the time.

### Node size

`--machine-type` lets us select how much [RAM and
CPU](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) each of our
nodes have. For non-trivial hubs, we generally pick `n2-highmem-8`, with
64G of RAM and 8 cores. This is based on the following heuristics:

1.  Students generally are memory limited than CPU limited. In fact,
    while we have a hard limit on memory use per-user pod, we do not
    have a CPU limit -it hasn\'t proven necessary.
2.  We try overprovision clusters by about 2x - so we try to fit about
    100G of total RAM use in a node with about 50G of RAM. This is
    accomplished by setting the memory request to be about half of the
    memory limit on user pods. This leads to massive cost savings, and
    works out ok.
3.  There is a kubernetes limit on 100 pods per node.

Based on these heuristics, `n2-highmem-8` seems to be most bang for the
buck currently. We should revisit this for every cluster creation.

### Cluster version

GKE automatically upgrades cluster masters, so there is generally no
harm in being on the latest version available.

### Node autoupgrades

When node autoupgrades are enabled, GKE will automatically try to
upgrade our nodes whenever needed (our GKE version falling off the
support window, security issues, etc). However, since we run stateful
workloads, we *disable* this right now so we can do the upgrades
manually.

### Network Policy

Kubernetes [Network
Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
lets you firewall internal access inside a kubernetes cluster,
whitelisting only the flows you want. The JupyterHub chart we use
supports setting up appropriate NetworkPolicy objects it needs, so we
should turn it on for additional security depth. Note that any extra
in-cluster services we run *must* have a NetworkPolicy set up for them
to work reliabliy.

### Subnetwork

We put each cluster in its own subnetwork, since *seems* to be a limit
on how many clusters you can create in the same network with IP aliasing
on - you just run out of addresses. This also gives us some isolation -
subnetworks are isolated by default and can\'t reach other resources.
You must add [firewall
rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls) to provide
access, including access to any manually run NFS servers. We add tags
for this.

### Tags

To help with firewalling, we add [network
tags](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags) to all
our cluster nodes. This lets us add firewall rules to control traffic
between subnetworks.

### Cluster name

We try use a descriptive name as much as possible.
