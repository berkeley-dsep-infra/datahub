### Service Accounts

Service accounts are identified by a *service key*, and help us grant
specific access to an automated process. Our CI process needs two
service accounts to operate:

1.  A `gcr-readwrite` key. This is used to build and push the user
    images. Based on the
    [docs](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control),
    this is assigned the role `roles/storage.admin`.
2.  A `gke` key. This is used to interact with the Google Kubernetes
    cluster. Roles [roles/container.clusterViewer]{.title-ref} and
    [roles/container.developer]{.title-ref} are granted to it.

These are currently copied into the `secrets/` dir of every deployment,
and explicitly referenced from `hubploy.yaml` in each deployment. They
should be rotated every few months.

You can [create service
accounts](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/how-to-version-control-jupyter)
through the web console or the commandline. Remember to not leave around
copies of the private key elsewhere on your local computer!
