#Process to publish policy proposals

- The policy subfolder inside the docs folder in the datahub repository acts as a single source of truth for all our policy-related proposals.
- Every PR  related to a specific policy will go through multiple reviews from the team before getting finalized and merged. Reviewers should be explicitly assigned in order to seek the required approval prior to merging the PR.
- Each policy issue area will get mapped to a specific policy document. Eg: The policy to create a new hub is currently mapped to the policy_create_hubs.rst file.
