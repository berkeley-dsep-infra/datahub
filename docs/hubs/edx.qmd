This hub is for the [data8x course on EdX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/berkeleyx-foundations-of-data-science).
It is open to use by anyone in the world, using [LTI
Authentication](https://github.com/jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator) to
provide login capability from inside EdX.

It runs on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) in the
`data8x-scratch` project. You can see all config for it under
`deployments/data8x`.
